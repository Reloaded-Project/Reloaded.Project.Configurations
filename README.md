# Reloaded Project Configurations

This page hosts the common configurations for various parts of the Reloaded project.

This includes:

- `.editorconfig` files for configuring code style.
- `Tests.Build.props` for common project settings for tests.
- `NuGet.Build.props` for common project settings that target NuGet.
- `Directory.Build.props` for common project settings.

## Usage

To use this repository, add it as a submodule to your project.

```
git submodule add https://github.com/Reloaded-Project/Reloaded.Project.Configurations.git ./src/Reloaded.Project.Configurations
```

Periodically update the submodule to the latest version.

```
git submodule update --remote
```

### Tests.Build.props

For test projects, modify your `.csproj` to include `Tests.Build.props` as follows:

```xml
<Import Project="../Reloaded.Project.Configurations/Tests.Build.props" />
```

You'll also need to add a startup class for Dependency Injection somewhere in the project

```csharp
public class Startup
{
    public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services) { }
}
```

### NuGet.Build.props

For packages that are shipped to NuGet, modify your `.csproj` to include `NuGet.Build.props` as follows:

```xml
<Import Project="../Reloaded.Project.Configurations/NuGet.Build.props" />
```

The following remaining properties should be manually specified per package:

```xml
<PackageProjectUrl>https://github.com/Reloaded-Project/Reloaded.Memory</PackageProjectUrl>
<Description>Package Description.</Description>
<Version>1.0.0</Version>
<Product>Cool Library Name</Product>
```

### Directory.Build.props

For any other projects, modify your `.csproj` to include `Directory.Build.props` as follows:

```xml
<Import Project="../Reloaded.Project.Configurations/Directory.Build.props" />
```

## Code Style

The code style is defined in the `.editorconfig` file in the root of the repo.

To apply this to your project, do the following:

- Enable symlinks for your current project by running `git config core.symlinks true`.
- Make symlink to `Reloaded.Project.Configurations/.editorconfig` in the root of your project.
- In PowerShell you can
  do `New-Item -Path ".editorconfig" -ItemType SymbolicLink -Value "Reloaded.Project.Configurations/.editorconfig"` as
  admin.
- Or on Linux, you can do `ln -s "Reloaded.Project.Configurations/.editorconfig" ".editorconfig"`.

### .solutionItems

In each project you should make a `.solutionItems` folder and add any useful files (as existing files) from the folder
the `.sln` is contained in; such that it's visible from the IDE. For example: `GitHub Actions`.

## File Layout

The following is the expected file layout for your project:

```
- docs/
- src/
```

The `docs` folder should contain all documentation for your project (if present).  
The `src` folder should contain all source code for your project.

## CI/CD Runs

For CI runs, you can use the following composite steps to set up the required tools and SDKs:

```yaml
- name: "Setup Reloaded Library SDKs & Components"
- uses: Reloaded-Project/Reloaded.Project.Configurations/.github/actions/setup-sdks-components@main
```

```yaml
# Showing default values, not all inputs are mandatory.
# Refer to actual upload-coverage-packages file for descriptions.
- name: "Upload Codecov Coverage, Changelog & NuGet Packages"
- uses: Reloaded-Project/Reloaded.Project.Configurations/.github/actions/upload-coverage-packages@main
  with:
    code-coverage-path: './Coverage.xml'
    changelog-path: './Changelog.md'
    nupkg-glob: './src/*.nupkg'
    nuget-key: ${{ secrets.NUGET_KEY }}
    changelog-template: 'keepachangelog'
    is-release: ${{ startsWith(github.ref, 'refs/tags/') }} # if 'true' publishes to GitHub Actions and NuGet
```

Replace `@main` with appropriate version tag if you want to pin to a specific version.

### Cross Targeting CI/CD Runs

Use the following template to run CI/CD for multiple target frameworks:

```yaml

  push:
    branches: [ main ]
    tags:
      - '*'
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]
  workflow_dispatch:

```

The required components for reporting coverage should already be there provided `NuGet.Build.props` is included as
instructed
in your test project.

## Auto Fix Public API Analyzer Warnings

!!! tip

    [Rider does not have a way to apply Roslyn code fixes in a larger scope](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/RIDER-18372),
    so working with [Public API Analyzer](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn-analyzers/blob/main/src/PublicApiAnalyzers/PublicApiAnalyzers.Help.md) might be painful.

To work around this, a `Powershell` script `FixUndeclaredAPIs.ps1` is included in repo root.
Use like this:

```powershell
.\FixUndeclaredAPIs.ps1 ../Your.Project/Your.Project.csproj
```

If you ever run into: `Could not load file or assembly 'Microsoft.CodeAnalysis, Version=4.5.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=31bf3856ad364e35'. The system cannot find the file specified.`, remove source generator project dependency temporarily.
